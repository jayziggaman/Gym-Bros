        I made this site to show clients who want proof of my front-end abilities. I can do more than this ( check my other sites from my profile ).

        <li>
          The forms do not get submitted anywhere, that's why I did not bother adding a 'payment' method in the register page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of the social media links do not work too. I do not have accounts on them, but the email link works.
